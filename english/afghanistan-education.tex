In the past, education in Afghanistan has been compromised by heavy conflict. Before the Taliban were overthrown in 2001, most children were not educated at all. However, even after 2001 there have been significant threats to education, especially of girls, in Afghanistan. Attacks on schools and pupils as well as threats to teachers have made it difficult for the Afghan government to sustain the number of children enrolled in schools. Custom in Afghanistan forbids boys and girls to mix, making mixed education a controversial topic. In addition to this, many qualified teachers have left Afghanistan because of the war, which has left the education system in Afghanistan in a devestating state.
